        <h4>Brain Imaging Analysis and Brain Science</h4>
            <p>Informatics-enabled studies are transforming brain science. New methodologies enhance human interpretive powers when dealing with big data sets increasingly derived from advanced neuro-imaging technologies, including fMRI, PET, and MEG, as well as from other sources like eye-tracking and from wearable, portable and micro devices. We focus on leveraging machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) to assist brain neurological disorder and diseases diagnosis, 
and developing new machine learning algorithms and tools with brain science research community. <br>
